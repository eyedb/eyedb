EYEDB Web Browser Installation and Configuration Procedure
----------------------------------------------------------

We assume that the EyeDB System is correctly installed on your computer.

First of all, you have to configure your httpd server and the EyeDB WWW
package.

You have to choose :

- a root directory for the EyeDB WWW package
  (for instance /usr/local/eyedb/www).

- a port for your http server
  (for instance 8092, so you can use the http server for local test).

- a communication port for the EyeDB WWW daemon
  (for instance 10000).

Let `marcello' be your hostname.
Let `/usr/local/apache' be the http apache directory.

HTTP CONFIGURATION
------------------

For instance, if you use the HTTP APACHE server, you must edit the
following configuration files:

---- the file conf/http.conf (may be called httpd.conf) -----

Port 8092

ServerRoot /usr/local/apache

---- conf/srm.conf file -----
Note: on new version of apache, there is no more srm.conf file. So the following lines
must be set in httpd.conf

DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs

ScriptAlias /eyedb/cgi-bin/ /usr/local/eyedb/www/cgi-bin/
Alias       /eyedb/         /usr/local/eyedb/www/

(MIND : you must put the ScriptAlias directive before the Alias directive
        because of the precedence of the Alias extensions.)



EyeDB WWW CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

You must now configure the EyeDB WWW files:

---- the files /usr/local/eyedb/www/browser.html and 
     /usr/local/eyedb/www/cbrowser.html ------

replace the line:

<form method=POST ACTION="http://HOSTNAME:PORT/eyedb/cgi-bin/eyedbcgi.sh?-dbdlggen">

by:

<form method=POST ACTION="http://marcello:8092/eyedb/cgi-bin/eyedbcgi.sh?-dbdlggen">


--- the file /usr/local/eyedb/www/cgi-bin/eyedbcgi.sh ----

# HOST   : the host on which the eyedbwwwd server is running.
# PORT   : the main port on which the eyedbwwwd server is listening.
# ALIAS  : the http alias for the cgi-bin script, for instance:
#          www.xxx.com/eyedb
# CGIDIR : the relative path of the directory of this cgi shell script
#          (default is cgi-bin)

edit the following lines as follows (according to our example):

PORT=10000
HOST=marcello
ALIAS=marcello:8092/eyedb
CGIDIR=cgi-bin

--- the environment variable EYEDBCGI ---

If you want to use the EyeDB browser with eyedboql, you must set
the environment variable EYEDBCGI to the following value (for our
example):

For bourne shells:
EYEDBCGI=http://marcello:8092/eyedb
export EYEDBCGI

For C-shells:
setenv EYEDBCGI http://marcello:8092/eyedb

RUNNING THE SERVICE
-------------------

(1) run the httpd daemon, for instance:

   httpd -f /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf

(2) run the eyedbwwwd daemon as follows:

    eyedbwwwd -sv_port 10000 &

    (the eyedb server must run before)


TESTING THE BROWSER
-------------------

Under your WEB browser, try the url:

http://marcello:8092/eyedb/

The EyeDB WWW root page should appear...

Then follow the instructions on this page.
